# open-lpr pretrained models

Pre trained models consisting of data from coco, open-lpr-dataset-plate-detection and other datasets.

This repository is part of the [OpenLPR project](https://github.com/faisalthaheem/open-lpr).

There are two models, a full precision fp32 model and a mixed prcision model. Both yield similar results. These models have been generated using the [Open LPR Dataset](https://github.com/faisalthaheem/open-lpr-dataset-plate-detection)

The training was conducated using images from [SSD Pytorch repository](https://github.com/faisalthaheem/SSD-pytorch)
